   - This will take you directly to the correct project!

## Option 2: Search in Google Cloud Console

2. **Click on the project dropdown** (top bar, next to "Google Cloud")
3. In the project selector dialog:
   - Look for projects containing "hope" or "swap"
   - Check for project ID: `hopeswap-62c55`
   - It might be named differently (like "My First Project" or your account name)
